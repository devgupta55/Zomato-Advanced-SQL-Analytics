## üìå Project Overview
This project demonstrates my SQL problem-solving skills through the analysis of data for Zomato, a popular food delivery company in India. The project involves setting up the database, importing data, handling null values, and solving a variety of business problems using complex SQL queries.

The workflow includes:
- **Database Setup:** Creation of the `zomato` database and the required tables.
- **Data Import:** Inserting sample data into the tables.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling null values and ensuring data integrity.
- **Business Problems:** Solving 20 specific business problems using SQL queries.

## üìã Core Research Questions
### Easy-Medium Questions

**Q.1** Write a query to find the top 5 most frequently ordered dishes by a customer called "Arjun Mehta" in the last 1 year.

**Q.2** Popular Time Slots: Identify the time slots during which the most orders are placed, based on 2-hour intervals.

**Q.3** Order Value Analysis: Find the average order value per customer who has placed more than 750 orders. Return `customer_name`, and `aov` (average order value).

**Q.4** High-Value Customers: List the customers who have spent more than 100K in total on food orders. Return `customer_name` and `customer_id`.

**Q.5** Orders Without Delivery: Write a query to find orders that were placed but not delivered. Return each restaurant name, city, and number of not delivered orders.

**Q.6** Restaurant Revenue Ranking: Rank restaurants by their total revenue from the last year, including their name, total revenue, and rank within their city.

**Q.7** Most Popular Dish by City: Identify the most popular dish in each city based on the number of orders.

**Q.8** Customer Churn: Find customers who haven‚Äôt placed an order in 2024 but did in 2023.

**Q.9** Cancellation Rate Comparison: Calculate and compare the order cancellation rate for each restaurant between the current year and the previous year.

**Q.10** Rider Average Delivery Time: Determine each rider's average delivery time.

### Advanced Questions & Analysis

**Q.11** Monthly Restaurant Growth Ratio: Calculate each restaurant's growth ratio based on the total number of delivered orders since its joining.

**Q.12** Customer Segmentation: Segment customers into 'Gold' or 'Silver' groups based on their total spending compared to the average order value (AOV). If a customer's total spending exceeds the AOV, label them as 'Gold'; otherwise, label them as 'Silver'. Write an SQL query to determine each segment's total number of orders and total revenue.

**Q.13** Rider Monthly Earnings: Calculate each rider's total monthly earnings, assuming they earn 8% of the order amount.

**Q.14** Rider Ratings Analysis: Find the number of 5-star, 4-star, and 3-star ratings each rider has. Riders receive this rating based on delivery time:

*   Orders delivered less than 15 minutes of order received time: 5-star rating.
*   Orders delivered between 15 and 20 minutes: 4-star rating.
*   Orders delivered after 20 minutes: 3-star rating.

**Q.15** Order Frequency by Day: Analyze order frequency per day of the week and identify the peak day for each restaurant.

**Q.16** Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Calculate the total revenue generated by each customer over all their orders.

**Q.17** Monthly Sales Trends: Identify sales trends by comparing each month's total sales to the previous month.

**Q.18** Rider Efficiency: Evaluate rider efficiency by determining average delivery times and identifying those with the lowest and highest averages.

**Q.19** Order Item Popularity: Track the popularity of specific order items over time and identify seasonal demand spikes.

**Q.20** Rank each city based on the total revenue for the last year 2023.
